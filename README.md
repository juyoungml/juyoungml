### Hi there! I'm [JuYoung Suk (석주영)](https://scottsuk0306.github.io/about)👋

I am a M.S. Student at KAIST AI, advised by Minjoon Seo.

I am interested in training strong {LLMs, LMMs, and others} with specailized capability (ex. evaluation) and utilizing them. I also love building tools and demos for real-world application of AI.
