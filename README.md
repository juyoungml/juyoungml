I am a M.S. Student at KAIST AI, advised by Minjoon Seo.

I am interested in training strong {LLMs, VLMs, and others} with specailized capability (ex. evaluation) and utilizing them. I also love building tools and demos for real-world application of AI. 

Reach out to me via email (juyoung@kaist.ac.kr) if you have any questions, or would like to collaborate with me!
