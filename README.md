### Hi there! I'm Juyoung ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. at KAIST AI under the guidance of Minjoon Seo.

I am focusing on training foundation models at scale ([[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15431)], [[2](https://huggingface.co/trillionlabs/Tri-7B)], [[3](https://huggingface.co/trillionlabs/Tri-21B)] and optimizing them for real-world applications ([[4](https://huggingface.co/trillionlabs/Tri-7B-Search-preview)]).

You might also know me from my work on [Prometheus 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01535).

If you have questions or collaboration ideas, please reach out via email (juyoung@kaist.ac.kr)!
