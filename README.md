I am a M.S. Student at KAIST, advised by Minjoon Seo.

I am interested in developing evaluation methods for {LLMs, VLLMs, and others} and utilizing them to enhance its ability. I also love building applications for solving real world problems.

Reach out to me via email (juyoung@kaist.ac.kr) if you have any questions, or would like to collaborate with me!
